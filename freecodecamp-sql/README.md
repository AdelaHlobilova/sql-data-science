- **Dataset:** Stores services, customers, and appointment details.  
- **Key SQL Concepts:**
  * **SQL:** Table creation, foreign keys, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, joins, and constraints.
  * **Bash:** User input handling, loops, `psql` commands, conditional logic, and database interaction.  

**Project 4: [Periodic Table Database](https://github.com/AdelaHlobilova/sql-data-science/tree/main/freecodecamp-sql/periodic-table-database)**
- **Objective:** Develop a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve information about chemical elements using a Bash script.

- **Key SQL Concepts:**
    * **SQL:** Table creation with constraints, foreign keys, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, `JOIN`, subqueries, and conditional filtering.
    * **Bash:** User input handling, `psql` queries, loops, conditionals, and formatted output retrieval.  
  
**Project 5: [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/AdelaHlobilova/sql-data-science/tree/main/freecodecamp-sql/number-guessing-game)**
- **Objective:** Develop a PostgreSQL-powered number guessing game using a Bash script, tracking user attempts and scores.
- **Dataset:** Stores player usernames, number of attempts, and best scores in a database table.
- **Key SQL & Bash Concepts:**
  * INSERT INTO, SELECT, UPDATE for database operations.
